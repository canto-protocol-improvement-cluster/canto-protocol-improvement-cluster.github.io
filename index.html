            <h2>Canto Protocol Improvement Proposal (CPIP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Canto Protocol Improvement Proposal (CPIP) process is managed and maintained by a
                    group of individual volunteers operating in the capacity of core contributors and maintainers.
                </li>
                <li>Subjects for potential CPIP acceptance should be first discussed within the Telegram. Once
                    sufficient discussion has been conducted and general consensus regarding the nature of the proposal
                    has been achieved, including a general idea for mechanism design and implementation considerations,
                    a forum post will be published on the <a href="https://forum.canto.build">community forum</a> to provide a high-level overview of the proposed
                    improvement.</li>
                <li>Based on community feedback, a final CPIP will be submitted as a PR to the Canto Core Protocol Implementation GitHub repository.</li>
                <li>Each PR will be reviewed by at least 3 contributors. Each contributor should respond with appropriate comments to acknowledge review of each individual PR.</li>
                <li>Should no changes be requested, a CPIP can be considered ready for the implementation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Core dev calls are held on a biweekly cadence. Although there are current discussions regarding how these calls will be publicly broadcast  
            in a manner that enables public participation, a definitive process is still being discussed. To take part in this conversation, please join the Telegram group listed above.</p>
